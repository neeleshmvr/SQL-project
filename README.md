Atliq hardware Finance and supply chain analysis

Welcome to the AtliQ Hardwares Finance & Supply Chain Analytics Project repository. This repository contains the code and SQL queries utilized for the Finance & Supply Chain Domain section of the Data Analytics Bootcamp at Codebasics.

**Overview**

In this project, we delve into a dataset related to Finance & Supply Chain within the domain of AtliQ Hardwares. AtliQ Hardwares is a renowned hardware company specializing in PCs, printers, mice, and computers, boasting a global presence.

**Project Objective**

This project focuses on analyzing and deriving actionable insights from a comprehensive database provided by AtliQ Hardware. The dataset encompasses key information related to sales, products, customers, and regional performance. The primary objective is to address targeted business questions concerning sales reporting, market trends, customer behavior patterns, and supply chain forecasting. Through this analysis, the project aims to support data-driven decision-making and contribute to strategic planning across various business functions.

**Problem Statement**

Due to the growing size of Excel files, AtliQ Hardware has been facing significant performance challenges, including system slowdowns and inefficiencies. To address this, the company has initiated a strategic project aimed at streamlining data operations. A dedicated team of data analysts has been assembled to transition from traditional Excel-based workflows to a more robust and scalable solution using MySQL as the primary database management system. By leveraging SQL queries to extract and analyze key insights from large datasets, the team aims to support informed decision-making, improve operational efficiency, and drive better business outcomes across the organization.

**Key findings**

* **Amazon** recorded the highest net sales in fiscal year 2021, totaling **\$109.03 million**, followed by **AtliQ Exclusive** with **\$79.92 million**.
* The **Indian market** generated the highest net sales, reaching **\$210.67 million** in FY 2021, followed by the **USA** with **\$132.05 million**.
* **Amazon** contributed approximately **13.23%** of the **total net sales** across all customers in FY 2021.
* Within the **APAC region**, Amazon accounted for the **highest share of net sales**, contributing **12.99%** among all customers in 2021.
* In the **APAC region**, **India** ranked **first** in terms of **total gross sales** for the year 2021.


### **What I Learned**

* Gained hands-on experience in writing **complex SQL queries** to extract actionable insights from structured datasets involving sales, customers, regions, and products.
* Developed a strong understanding of **JOIN operations**, **GROUP BY**, **aggregate functions**, and **window functions** to perform in-depth data analysis and generate performance metrics.
* Learned to create and manage **Views** to simplify recurring queries and ensure better data abstraction for reporting tasks.
* Implemented **Stored Procedures** to automate frequently used logic, improving query efficiency and scalability.
* Explored the use of **User-Defined Functions (UDFs)** to modularize logic, making queries more readable and reusable.
* Understood the **importance of ERD (Entity Relationship Diagrams)** in visualizing data structures, enabling better database design and efficient query planning.
* Practiced using **EXPLAIN** and **ANALYZE** to evaluate query performance and optimize long-running queries by identifying execution bottlenecks.
* Applied **subqueries** and **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)** to break down complex logic into manageable components.
* Learned the role of **data normalization** and schema integrity in ensuring consistent, scalable, and maintainable database systems.
* Gained exposure to **real-world datasets** and practiced converting messy Excel-based reporting into efficient, query-driven analysis using **MySQL**

This project not only strengthened my foundational knowledge of SQL but also taught me how to think like a data analystâ€”leveraging relational databases to solve real business problems through clean, efficient, and insightful queries
